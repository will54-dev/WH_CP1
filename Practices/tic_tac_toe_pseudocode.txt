 WH 2nd tic tac toe pseudocode practice

 get a random function 
 set contaners Game Bord, score, Game Bord win
 set game bord to a lsit of 3 sets of 3
    will look like this [[-,-,-],[-,-,-],[-,-,-]]
 set Game Bord Win lsit of 9
 set score to player 0, computer 0

 loop forever:
    show: your turn you are x
    ask for a X
    check if X is grator than 0 and less that 4 and still a wholle number if not ask for X
    ask for a y
    check if Y is grator than 0 and less that 4 and still a wholle number if not ask for Y
    if list X of Y in Game Bord not a X or O
        looking at Y that x
        y set is x set, x set, and x set
        x set is -,-, and -
        if true:
            add X at list X of Y in Game Bord
        else:
            repeat 11 throgh 22

    have a random number grator or equal to 1 and less or equal to 3 wholle number = X
    have a random number grator or equal to 1 and less or equal to 3 wholle number = Y
        if list X of Y in Game Bord not a X or O
        if true:
            add X at list X of Y in Game Bord
        else:
            repeat 24 throgh 30
    
    for evry item in Game Bord run once (9):
        if item in Game Bord == X 
            add to position in Game Bord Win
    if Game Bord Win == All tic tac toe win conditions
        show: you win
        add one to player wins
        reset Game Bord
    for evry item in Game Bord run once (9):

            add to position in Game Bord Win
